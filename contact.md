## Communication and Community Guidelines

We provide a variety ways to get in touch with us. The following guidelines apply for all ways of interaction with users and developers.

* be nice: Treat people with respect and consideration
* be helpful: Be patient and willingly to answer any kind of question
* be patient: People have different priorities so allow people time to answer questions
* on-topic: Don't drift away from the topic as often as possible
* use search: Check first if there was already a discussion about the topic of your question. If not go further and ask.

The list of rules can extended related to the selected channel.

## [github organization](https://github.com/codeaffen){:target="_blank"}

All our project are organised in a github organization. Here we provide issue tracking and forums for each project. So the organization should be the first starting point to get in touch with developers and maintainers.

### github issues

To report found bugs or ideas for our projects we provide issue templates for *Bug reports* and *Reature request*. With these templates we guarantee a formal way of reporting such kind of issues. Please provide all requested information as a minimum. All extra information are welcome.

### github discussion

In all of our projects we use the github discussion system to provide a way to have discussion with users and developers. Other as IRC the discussion persists in this media so others get the chance to read it later.

## [libera.chat](https://libera.chat){:target="_blank"}

We started two IRC channels to provide real-time help. It would be nice to see you soon here.

For questions of using our software or discussion about articles here you can use our user channel:

* #codeaffen on [libera.chat](https://libera.chat){:target="_blank"}

For any development related topics please feel free to use the development channel:

* #codeaffen-dev on [libera.chat](https://libera.chat){:target="_blank"}

### IRC Guidelines

In addition to the [general guidelines](https://theforeman.org/support.html#CommunityGuidelines){:target="_blank"} above, we also have a few IRC-specific guidelines:

* Don’t post chunks: Avoid posting big chunks of text - use a [pastebin](http://pastie.org/){:target="_blank"} or similar service to shorten it to a link. Likewise, try not to spam the channel with many messages, it breaks the flow of other conversations.
* Don’t private message: Ask permission before you send someone a private message (PM). Not everyone likes them. Also, by keeping it in public, others with similar issues can see the solution you were given.
* Don’t highlight specific people unless you are already discussing something with them. Highlighting a specific user with your opening question makes it far less likely others will respond.

We think, that communications are very important. Besides the technical approach at [codeaffen @ github](https://github.com/codeaffen/codeaffen.org), we're currently establishing the project on other channels too. We decided to get started on (https://keybase.io), where you can reach us on our [team channel](https://keybase.io/team/codeaffen). Just request an invite and join us for learning, sharing and exchanging words, ideas and code. See you there!

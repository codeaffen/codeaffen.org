We are proud to announce the release of version 1.1.0 of p3exporter.

We have continued to work on standardization for new collectors. For that purpose we introduced the `CollectorBase` class.
We also add a first version of decorator to use least recently used caches in collectors.

To reduce the size of the docker image we switched to vanilla `alpine:3` as base image.

## New

* introduce `CollectorBase` class to derive new collectors from
* added cache module with timed lru cache
* add netdev collector for network information and statistics

## Changes

* reduce docker image size
* we switched base image from python:3-slim to alpine

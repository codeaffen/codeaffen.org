In January we decided to start with [keybase](2021-01-05-contact-us-at-keybase) as communication platform. Unfortunately this network is not so popular as it should be. As we don't want to use networks like slack only because all others do this we now opened two IRC channels on [Libera.chat](https://libera.chat){:target="_blank"} as this technology is well tested and a good point for finding together quick and easy. 

## User channel

If you are a user of our software or you visit our blog and wants to ask questions regarding it:

* #codeaffen - User channel on [Libera.chat](https://libera.chat){:target="_blank"}

Here you can ask questions regarding all topics of using our software, or we can discuss about blog post.

## Developer channel

Your want to aks questions regarding contributions or other developer related issues to our projects:

* #codeaffen-dev - Developer channel on [Libera.chat](https://libera.chat){:target="_blank"}

This is the right place to discuss all of the above. But beware, the usage of the channel don't save the work for opening bug report or feature requests on github. We can discuss it there but for a more persistent work on such kind of things we should use github issues instead.

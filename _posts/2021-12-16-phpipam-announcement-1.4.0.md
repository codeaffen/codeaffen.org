We are proud to announce the release of version 1.4.0 of phpipam-ansible-modules.

This release contains two new modules and a few bug fixes.

## Minor Changes

- Minor formatting and spelling fixes.
- Switch sphinx from recommonmark to myst_parser.

## Bugfixes

- fix \#57 - tag lookups failed when specified in an `address` task
- fix \#61 - Device type examples
- with [AHH538](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/AAH-538){:target="_blank"} `requires_ansible` is mandatory in `meta/runtime.yml`. So we add the minimum version for our collection here.
